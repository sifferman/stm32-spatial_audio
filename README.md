## Description

Apple has released headphones that simulate surround sound. By turning your head, the audio seems to change the location it comes from. I will do my best to replicate this feature. My final product will be used as follows:

1. Connect the Discovery Board to a computer.
2. Plug in headphones to the Discoveryâ€™s headphone jack.
3. Run a custom C++ script on the computer to send the wave file to the STM32.
4. Place the Discovery Board on your head.
5. Rotate your head to experience the 3D sound.
