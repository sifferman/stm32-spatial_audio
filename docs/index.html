    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Apple has released headphones that simulate surround sound. By turning your head, the audio seems to change the location it comes from. I will do my best to replicate this feature. My final product will be used as follows:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sync the connected HC-05 module to a computer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Plug in headphones to the Discovery&rsquo;s headphone jack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Run a custom C++ script on the computer to send the wave file to the HC-05.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the Discovery Board with its accelerometer on your head.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rotate your head to experience the 3D sound.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3.12 Update</h2>
    <p>
        This week I set up the headphone jack. Oh my god this sucked! Thank you Emily for all the help! Here is the code: <a href="https://github.com/E4tHam/stm32-spatial_audio/tree/1f1e148eab3b8830f1612904a2ebf1cbfd6abaeb/stm32/src" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repository</a>. I heavily used this <a href="https://github.com/deater/vmw-meter/tree/master/stm32L476/chiptune_cs43l22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference project</a> to learn how to interface with the cs43l22.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I can open Wave files on my computer, convert them to a bit depth of 8, send them over UART, and have them play out of the headphone jack. However, the audio plays faster than the computer sends data, so the sound breaks up. I have several ideas for how to fix that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is what I believe I have left to do:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix the bug where the PC stops sending data.</li>
        <li>Find the goldilocks baud rate.</li>
        <li>Play audio samples at scaled volumes according to accelerometer.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>3.05 Update</h2>
    <p>
        This week I fixed bugs with UART and Bluetooth. Now I know that the HC-05 is too slow for my needs, so I will be instead using USB at 1.5Mbps.
    </p>
    <p>
        I made a <a href="https://github.com/E4tHam/stm32-spatial_audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repository</a> for all my code. I have finished the PC code. In its <code>main()</code>, if the STM32 is ready, it will send audio samples. I also have a thread that is polling RX for status bytes from the STM32. If a 'g' was recieved, a sample will be sent; if a 'B' was recieved, it <code>main()</code> will stall.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only thing I have left is setting up the headphone jack. I will be doing this next week while using this <a href="https://github.com/deater/vmw-meter/tree/master/stm32L476/chiptune_cs43l22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reference project</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2.26 Update</h2>
    <p>
        This week, I found a library on GitHub so that I can send a UART signal through C++ code.
    </p>
    <a href="https://github.com/manashmandal/SerialPort" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SerialPort - C++ Library for Serial Communication with following criteria</a>
    <p>
        Using this, I redid lab 4 part a.
    </p>

    <p>
        This weekend, I will send Wave file data instead of text. Over the week, I will solve the bounded buffer problem for incoming/playing samples.
    </p>
